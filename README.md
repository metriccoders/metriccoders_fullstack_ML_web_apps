# Full Stack ML Web Apps - Metric Coders

Welcome to the Metric Coders Github repository! This repository contains a comprehensive list of all our Full Stack Machine Learning Web Applications. The applications are powered by open source Large Language Models that can be downloaded directly from Hugging Face. Also, you can find models created by Metric Coders. In such instances, the models are present in the same repository.

## Technologies Used

Our applications are built using a variety of technologies:

- Frontend: **React JS**, **Next JS**
- ML Models: Various Machine Learning models including:
  - **PyTorch Models**
  - **Keras Models**
  - **Scikit-learn Models**
  - **Generative AI models like Llama 2, Mistral AI and others**
- Backend API: Run models using Fastapi  

## Applications

Each application in this repository is contained in its own directory and includes its own README with specific information about the application.
- The applications list includes:
  - Metric Coders - General GPT powered by Llama2
    - frontend: https://github.com/metriccoders/frontend-chatgpt
    - backend: https://github.com/metriccoders/chatgpt_llama2_backend
  - Metric Coders - General GPT powered by Mistral AI
    - frontend: https://github.com/metriccoders/chatgpt_mistralai_frontend
    - backend: https://github.com/metriccoders/chatgpt_mistral_ai_backend


We hope you find these applications useful and encourage you to contribute!
